# Code of Conduct

## Attitude and culture

- Treat each other with respect.
- Intend to develop personal relationships, to enhance trust and open communication.
- Value constructive feedback. Avoid being defensive and give feedback in a constructive manner.
- Strive to recognize and celebrate individual and team accomplishments.
- Pitch in to help where necessary to help solve problems and catch-up on work behind schedule.

## Team meetings

- The team leader must publish and distribute an agenda. Team members are responsible for contacting the team leader with any agenda items they want to include. Agenda items can be added at the meeting with the consensus of the team.
- Additional meetings can be scheduled to discuss critical issues or tabled items, upon discussion and agreement with the team leader.
- Meetings always start at the scheduled time, and all members are expected to be on-time. If, due to extenuating circumstances, a member is late, said member must catch-up on their own.
- No responsibilities are to be assigned unless the person being assigned the responsibility accepts it. If a person to be given a responsibility is not at the meeting, the team leader must review that assignment with said person before the responsibility is designated.

## Communication and decision-making

- One person talks at a time; there are no side discussions.
- Each person is given a chance to speak their mind while at the same time respecting the group’s time and the meeting's agenda.
- Value open and honest communication – no hidden agendas.
- De-personalize discussion of issues – no attacks directed at people.
- Listen, be non-judgmental and keep an open mind on all issues.
- Emphasize the balanced participation of all team members, and use a consensus for important decisions and issues. For less important issues, rely on the subject matter expert with input from others.

## Planning and management

- Accept the responsibility and accountability along with the authority given.
- Maintain the team's work plan and schedule.
- If a team member believes they are being asked to do a task outside the scope of the team’s charter, said member must bring this to the attention of the team leader for resolution.
- When posing an issue or a problem, one must also try to present a solution.
- Team commitments shouldn’t be made lightly, but those that are made must be kept.
