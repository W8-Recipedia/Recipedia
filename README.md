# Recipedia

Recipedia is a web application that seeks to revolutionize the way that people find personalised recipes. It recommends the most suitable recipes to users based on their dietary preferences, allergies, and much more. It also has a search function, which allows user to filter recipes by cuisine, diet, or calories.

Recipedia is built with the PERN stack; it uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes according to user provided data, and beautifully displays them in the browser using Material UI for React. All user data is encrypted and stored securely in a remote PostgreSQL database, and recipes are recommended using our proprietary algorithms written in Express.
